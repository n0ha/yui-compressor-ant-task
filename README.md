Yahoo UI's great Rhino based compressor packaged as an Ant task.

NOTICE: Archived repo as there is an existing maven plugin at https://github.com/hazendaz/yuicompressor-maven-plugin/ that can be used to do the same.  In fact, items that exist in mavne should be used in favor of ant.
        One can still use ant for ant specific items but does not need to have all tools inside ant.  Let maven do the bulk of work and let ant do only what is left over.
